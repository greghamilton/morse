# morse

Morse code for the MC-10.

Sound is generated by the timer OCF interrupt ISR. The tone will play continuously while the interrupt is enabled.

Start the tone.
```
POKE 8,8
```

Stop the tone.
```
POKE 8,0
```

The OCF interrupt occurs when the free running timer value matches the value stored in OCR ($0B). With each interrupt OCR is updated to the current timer value + a configurable delay.

This delay can be modified from BASIC.

```
EN=8:DH=36397:DL=36398
POKE DH,8:REM DELAY HIGH BYTE
POKE DL,0:REM DELAY LOW BYTE
POKE EN,8:REM START TONE
POKE EN,0:REM STOP TONE
```
Use lower values to increase the pitch. Anything less than $0800 sounds a bit harsh to me. Your mileage may vary.

For a pitch approximately equivalent to ```SOUND 200,1``` try ...

```
POKE DH,2
POKE DL,128
```
